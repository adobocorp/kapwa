I'm building a directory and I need the details from the pdf in json format 


Extracting LGU data:

Extract the city and municipality goverment data from this PDF

The data looks like table based in the format of for most except National Capital Region

City Governments have this format
Region:
Province, City, Mayor + Contact, Vice Mayor + Contact


Municipal Governments have this format in the table
Province:
Municipality, Zip Code, Mayor + Contact, Vice Mayor + Contact

We can put the municipalities under the region as well if you can match them
